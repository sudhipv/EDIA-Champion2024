This repository contains documents, codes, presentations, and all other related works done towards the project " Computational Modelling of Real World Problems using DRI and Community Outreach". This project is done as part of the EDIA-Champions Pilot Program 2024. 


# Project Details

## 🎯 Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** 
   - Develop state-of-the-art AI tools for the health sector utilizing DRI resources.
      
   - Be an educator and leader in science communication.

- **Mission:** 
  -   Advancements in the technical aspects of the project by enrolling in the latest technological
      courses fromreputed universities/organizations, interacting with leaders in the research and
      progressing with feedback from mentors.

  -   Gain leadership qualities and educate the general public by conducting webinars and
      in-person meetings with student researchers from the university. Further, significant
       outreach to the general audience using social media, YouTube etc.


## ✨ Milestones

🥇 Conducted a webinar to fellow researchers from University of Western Ontario on DRAC resources and collected their feedback. This is added inside the folder named Webinar.


🥇 Conducted a hands-on session to fellow researchers from Carleton University showcasing an introductory course to high performance computing. The codes used for this session is available inside the folder Hands-on.

🥇 Conducted a one-to-one online intrview with "Artur Estrela da Silva", Vice President, Student Issues, Carleton University Students Association. The details of the interview are provided in the folder named interview.
